title: 2.2.1 hotfix released
---

After the [2.2.0 release last night]({% post_url 2012-10-29-bootstrap-2-2-0-released %}), a few bugs were reported, but only one major one: [malfunctioning carousels](https://twitter.com/getbootstrap/status/263327129905811459). To address that, [@fat](https://twitter.com/fat) just pushed out a 2.2.1 hotfix release that fixes the bug. Upgrading should be super simple given the scope of this release.

Once more, apologies for any hiccups and happy Bootstrapping!
