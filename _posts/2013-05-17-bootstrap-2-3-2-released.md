title: Bootstrap 2.3.2 released
---

This morning we pushed out a 2.3.2 patch release to address a single bug (<a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/7118" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see #7118</a>) related to dropdowns and command/control clicking links in Firefox.

Work on Bootstrap 3 continues and we're almost ready to do an official release candidate. We've addressed nearly all our chosen changes and are now at a point where we're smoothing things out as much as possible. We'll share more information on the RC and v3 in the coming weeks.
