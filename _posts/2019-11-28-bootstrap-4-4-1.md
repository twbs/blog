title: Bootstrap 4.4.1
---

Today we're shipping [Bootstrap v4.4.1](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v4.4.1)! In v4.4.0, we've added new `add()` and `subtract()` functions to avoid errors when using zero values in CSS's built in `calc()` function. While these functions work as expected with our build which is based on `node-sass`, some alert developers [noticed](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/29743) that things broke when using another Sass compiler like Dart Sass or Ruby Sass. To resolve this issue, we've tweaked these functions a bit to output what we would expect. Lastly, we also added a theming [fix](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/29762) for some custom forms in a disabled fieldset.
