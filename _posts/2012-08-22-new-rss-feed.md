title: New RSS feed
---

Roughly two weeks ago we upgraded the blog to use Jekyll and GitHub Pages instead of WordPress. When we did that, we forgot about the RSS feed. A few awesome folks noted we were missing it and so we've added it back. Unfortunately it's not the same URL, but it's there nonetheless.

Here's the URL for the new feed: [http://blog.getbootstrap.com/feed.xml](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/feed.xml).

It's also in the `<head>` of the blog's pages, so entering just the root URL should resolve fine for you in most RSS apps. Again, sorry for the oversight and please continue to let us know if we can do anything else to improve the blog.

Thanks!
