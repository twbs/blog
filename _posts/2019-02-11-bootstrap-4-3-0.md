Bootstrap v4.3 has landed with over 120 combined closed issues and merged pull requests. This release brings improvements to our utilities, some prep work for moving on to v5's development, and the standard bug fixes and documentation updates.

During our last release, we shared a small preview of where we're taking the project next. That's getting clearer in the coming weeks as our attention turns towards embracing Hugo for ultra fast docs development, removing jQuery in favor of regular JavaScript, and addressing our growing code base.

Keep reading for v4.3 highlights, and see you soon with more details on v5!

## Highlights

We've added some new utilities and deprecated some unused code. Here are the key changes in v4.3, broken down by new, improved, fixed, and deprecated.

- **New:** Added `.stretched-link` utility to make any anchor the size of it's nearest `position: relative` parent, perfect for entirely clickable cards!
- **New:** Added `.text-break` utility for applying `word-break: break-word`
- **New:** Added `.rounded-sm` and `.rounded-lg` for small and large `border-radius`.
- **New:** Added `.modal-dialog-scrollable` modifier class for scrolling content _within_ a modal.
- **New:** Added responsive `.list-group-horizontal` modifier classes for displaying list groups as a horizontal row.
- **Improved:** Reduced our compiled CSS by using `null` for variables that by default inherit their values from other elements (e.g., `$headings-color` was `inherit` and is now `null` until you modifier it in your custom CSS).
- **Improved:** Simplified popover arrow CSS by generating arrows on the `.popover` instead of an additional element, `.popover-arrow`.
- **Improved:** Badge focus styles now match their `background-color` like our buttons.
- **Fixed:** Reverted v4.2.1's change to the breakpoint and grid container Sass maps that blocked folks from upgrading when modifying those default variables.
- **Fixed:** Restored `white-space: nowrap` to `.dropdown-toggle` (before v4.2.1 it was on all `.btn`s) so carets don't wrap to new lines.
- **Deprecated:** `img-retina`, `invisible`, `float`, and `size` mixins are now deprecated and will be removed in v5.

## Introducing responsive font sizes

Our biggest new addition to Bootstrap in v4.3 is responsive font sizes, a [new project in the Bootstrap GitHub org](https://github.com/twbs/rfs) to automate calculate an appropriate `font-size` based on the dimensions of a visitor's device or browser viewport. Here's how it works:

- All `font-size` properties have been switched to the `@include font-size()` mixin. Our Stylelint configuration now prevents the usage of `font-size` property.

- Disabled by default, you can opt into this new behavior by toggling the `$enable-responsive-font-sizes` boolean variable.

- The base `font-size` is set via the `$rfs-base-font-size` Sass variable. Modifying that value and recompiling will automatically modify any element's font-size when using the new mixin.

We've enabled responsive font-sizes in our own docs starting with v4.3. Please share feedback with us via GItHub issues or on Twitter. We've added some light guidance to [our Typography docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/typography/#responsive-font-sizes) to explain the feature. You can also learn more by [reading the rfs project documentation](https://github.com/twbs/rfs).

## Branches, Hugo, and jQuery

Right after shipping v4.3, we'll be tackling a few key changes on our road to active v5 development. These are larger changes to how we maintain and develop Bootstrap and are considered foundational for v5.

- **Improving our branches for development.** `master` will become our new `v3-dev` branch (used only for critical security fixes). `v4-dev` will stay as-is, but we'll cut a new `master` branch from there to develop v5.

- **We've moving to Hugo!** Jekyll has been great, but it's starting to slow us down in local development. We'll be making changes to our dependencies to support this move, and there's already a pull request in progress and near completion for the change. [Follow along](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/28014) to see what's changing.

- **We're dropping jQuery for regular JavaScript.** The cat is out of the bag—we're dropping our largest client-side dependency for regular JavaScript. Similar to the Hugo move, we've been working on this for a long time and have a [pull request in progress](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/23586) and near completion.

We'll have even more to share soon around v5's plans after we tackle these bigger items. In the meantime, keep the feedback coming on GitHub and Twitter!
