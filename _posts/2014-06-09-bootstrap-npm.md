It's taken us awhile, but we've finally [published Bootstrap on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bootstrap). We've taken over the existing `bootstrap` package and just published the latest release, v3.1.1. The package is managed by the [twbs user](https://npmjs.org/~twbs), just like on GitHub. In the future, when we release new versions of Bootstrap, we'll update npm as well.

Speaking of releases, you can expect v3.2.0 sometime later this month. Woohoo!
