[Alpha 4 is here](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com) to address those pesky build and package errors, a few CSS bugs, and some documentation inconsistencies we introduced in our last release.

This is a super small release compared to our previous alphas, so here's the rundown on what's changed:

- Fixed `package.json` errors
- Additional migration notices for more components
- Fix broken flexbox utilities on flexbox grid page
- Fix inconsistent checkbox and radio markup, as well as validation styles
- Minor tweaks to cards, alerts, utilities, and input groups

For more details on this release's changes, take a look at the [Alpha 4 ship list issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20373), as well as the [closed Alpha 4 milestone](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/milestone/40?closed=1).
