We're closing in on 700 icons in Bootstrap Icons with today's release, Alpha 4! We've spent some time under the hood of our build process to improve a few things, added tons of new icons, and fixed some bugs and inconsistencies.

We've shipped tons of new commerce icons for all your shopping cart needs, added tons of calendar options (I couldn't settle on one design), tons of new shape arrows, and more.

## ~700 icons!

With 140 new icons in this release, we've almost hit 700 icons. We're likely to fly by that in our next release, but in the mean time, have a look for yourself at the breadth of icons. Every icon has also been reprocessed to resolve SVGO issues that prevented them from being opened in some apps.
