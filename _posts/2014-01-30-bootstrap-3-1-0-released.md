---

Today we're stoked to ship Bootstrap v3.1. We've got a handful of new features, plenty of bug fixes and improvements, and updated build tools.

### New docs

[![New Bootstrap docs](/assets/img/2014/01/docs.png)]({{ site.main }}/getting-started/)

We've made tons of changes across the board, most notably to our documentation. Just like v2.1 brought a brand new design, v3.1 overhauls the docs to refocus on the actual documentation rather than the chrome around it. Our new homepage restores the quick run through of key features and showcases some awesome examples from the Expo.

### Official Sass port

[![Bootstrap for Sass](/assets/img/2014/01/sass.png)](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)

The best part about v3.1 is that we're shipping with an official Sass port. A few weeks ago we moved over the most popular port on GitHub and made it official—Bootstrap is now available in Sass. Rather than bloat the main project with support for Less and Sass—and all the documentation for both—we've kept them separate for the time being. Prominent links in the docs are included though, so enjoy!

### New examples

We've added three new examples: Blog, Cover, and Dashboard. Each example provides a single page of awesomeness for you to quickly get started on a project built with Bootstrap. They're responsive and ready to go.

### Improved features

A handful of features that aren't exactly new to Bootstrap have seen an update in v3.1:

- Modals now include optional sizes
- Dropdowns now have their own alignment classes for easier customization
- Form feedback styles for validation states now include optional icons to reinforce color changes

All-in-all these make components more focused, more durable, and easier to work with. See the changelog included with [the GitHub release](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v3.1.0) for the complete list of new features.

### Remote modal content

One of the more important improved features is for our modals. If you currently use the modal's `remote` option, be aware this release may break your modals. Yes, this is a breaking change, but it's first and foremost a **bug fix** that corrects a rather longstanding and overlooked error. Our apologies for any headaches it may cause, but it's been missed in the last few patch releases.

See the [#11933](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11933) pull request for details on the code changes.


### New license

We've been talking about it for what seems like forever, but thanks to all our contributors and the core team, we've finally done it. As of v3.1, Bootstrap ships under the MIT license to allow as many people to utilize Bootstrap as possible. Thanks to all our contributors for helping make it happen.

### Improved build tools

We're constantly trying to improve our tools for developing Bootstrap and v3.1 brings a slew of updates to do just that.

- We've switched from Recess to grunt-contrib-less for our compiler, giving us access to Less 1.6.x (as opposed to 1.3.x with Recess).
- Our compiled code is virtually identical in formatting and organization thanks to [CSScomb](http://csscomb.com/) and some other Grunt-fu.
- Tests also run a tad faster with the help of some magical caching and parallelization.
- The web Customizer is now generated from a Grunt task, meaning we'll never miss updating or adding a variable again. If you contribute to Bootstrap regularly, just run `grunt` and commit to update the page.

**Heads up!** If you develop Bootstrap locally, be sure to nuke your `node_modules/` directory and run `npm install` before getting started with v3.1.

## Full changelog

### New features

- Three new templates: Blog, Cover, and Dashboard.
- [#10884](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/10884): Add `.info` variant to contextual table classes.
- [#11138](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11138): Add contextual styles to list groups.
- [#11162](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11162): Add new sizes, `.modal-lg` and `.modal-sm`, to modals for quicker settings on modals. Only applies to modals above the small breakpoint.
- [#11193](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11193): Add `<kbd>` element styles to indicate user input via keyboard.
- [#11244](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11244): Add `.animation()` mixins.
- [#11572](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11572): Add contextual `background-color` classes to match our existing text classes. (This also moves both sets of classes to the Helper Classes section of the CSS docs.)
- [#11675](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11675): Add `.text-justify` class to round out the text alignment classes.
- [#11836](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11836): Add new form control feedback classes to toggle icons for each validation state. Works on regular forms, horizontal, and inline.

While we originally wanted v3.1 to include RTL support, we decided to hold back on that for some potentially beneficial unreleased tooling. We'll share more on that when we know more, but suffice to say it's been bumped to v3.2.


### CSS changes

- [#10951](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/10951): Add `outline: 0` to `.modal` to prevent a focus outline from appearing in Chrome for Windows.

- [#11266](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11266): Apply a pixel-based `line-height` that matches the `height` to date inputs for iOS 7 for proper vertical alignment of text in the form control.
- [#11286](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11286): Add `@well-border` variable.
- [#11302](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11302): Refactor the responsive utility classes to cut a few hundred lines of CSS (more context in #11214).

- [#11561](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11561): Add `float: left;` to `.form-control`s within input groups to prevent IE9 from screwing up placeholder text and select menu arrows.
- [#11588](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11588): Scope `font-size` to only `<p>` elements in `.jumbotron`s and remove the super-sized `line-height` from the base class to avoid interference with sub-components.
- [#11676](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11676): Add `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` to modals for smooth scrolling on iOS devices.
- [#11744](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11744): Clean up some incompatible properties in `forms.less`: block level inputs no longer receive `vertical-align: middle;` unless necessary, e.g. in inline forms.
- [#11748](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11748): Updated `.scale()` mixin so that it accepts optional vertical scale as second parameter.

- [#11741](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11741): Don't set `@headings-font-family` to the same font stack as the `<body>`; instead, just use `inherit` for same default CSS.
- [#11786](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11786): Nest media queries within print utilities for mixin-friendliness.
- [#11790](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11790): With upgrade to Less v1.6.0, remove duplicate CSS generated from the nested `.clearfix` class and mixin by switching to `&:extend(.clearfix all)`.

- [#11817](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11817): Rework input groups to use the `font-size: 0;` and `white-space: nowrap` hack for a more durable component with regards to code formatting and custom font size changes.

- [#11836](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11836): Along with the form validation update, we reset some key form and icon styles:
  - All `.form-control`s within inline forms are set to `width: auto;` to prevent stacking of `.form-label` within a `.form-group`.

- [#12388](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/12388): Apply a fixed `height` to `.navbar-brand` to ensure adding a Glyphicon doesn't increase it's height.

### Deprecations

- [#10370](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/10370): Deprecated the `.pull-right` method for aligning dropdown menus. Includes the following changes:
  - Removed an old and unused pair of selectors that didn't properly target the right-aligned navbar alignment of dropdown menus.
  - Deprecates the `.pull-right` alignment in favor of a more specific and unique class name.
  - Adds `.dropdown-menu-right` as the new alignment class. This is then mixin-ed into the `.navbar-right.navbar-nav` dropdown menus for auto-alignment (keeping the current behavior we have today).
  - Adds new ability to override that auto-alignment though with the new `.dropdown-menu-left`, which is mixin-ed in the same way to provide the appropriate specificity of an override. This should never need to be used except for within right-aligned `.navbar-nav` components.
- [#11660](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11660): Deprecate `small` and `.small` in `blockquote` citation in favor of `footer` element.
