title: Now powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages
---

Sorry about the database connection issues some of you may have seen in the last 24 hours. We've moved off WordPress for our blog and are now using GitHub pages and Jekyll. Jekyll is an amazingly lightweight and simple site generator from Tom Preston-Werner, cofounder of GitHub. Here's why:

* Instead of a database, we have flat Markdown files.
* Instead of hosting code on servers from Media Temple or another hosting provider, everything is on GitHub.
* The posting process is as simple as writing a post and pushing the `gh-pages` branch.

It's simple, fast, and pain free. We love it and encourge you to check it out in the future. Stay tuned in the next two weeks or so for more information on our next release. Until then, enjoy the updated blog.
