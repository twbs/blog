We're a few weeks out from v4.1 and we have our first patch release of Bootstrap 4! It's a straightforward set of bug fixes and build tool quality of life updates.

Here's a quick rundown of some of the changes:

- Added validation styles for file inputs
- Improved printing of dark tables
- Suppressed that `text-hide` deprecation notice by default
- Fixed an issue where Collapse wasn't working in Internet Explorer
- Cleaned up some JS globals and improve coverage
- Bumped dependencies, namely Jekyll
- Fixed docs issue with incorrect name for our monospace font utility

Checkout the full [v4.1.1 ship list](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25971) and [GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/13) for the full details. Up next will be [v4.1.2](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/14), another patch release to address the next set of CSS and JS bugs you've help share with us since v4 launched.
