There's a brand new update of Bootstrap Icons today with our second alpha release! We've updated nearly 20 icons and added over 100 new icons since our last release just a few weeks ago.

## New icons

With over 120 new and updated icons, this is likely going to be our largest update before we our first stable release. We have some renamed icons, fixed bugs, new tools icons, new typography icons, tons of new arrows, and so much more.
