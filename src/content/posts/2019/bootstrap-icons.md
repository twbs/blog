Say hello to [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), our very first icon set that's designed entirely by our team and open sourced for everyone to use, with or without Bootstrap. It's still in alpha, but we're incredibly excited to share it with y'all ahead of our v5 alpha.

For the longest time, I've wanted to design an icon set to better lean how to better draw with different pen tools and to better understand SVGs. In the last several months I've used a few different applications, done nearly five style iterations, and finally settled on a single direction. The result? Over 200 icons to start.

I've designed these initial icons in Figma and exported them as SVGs. The plan is to share that Figma file publicly once it's cleaned up and the icon set is  more stable. While Bootstrap Icons are first and foremost designed to work with Bootstrap's components, they can be used anywhere. They're an entirely [separate project](https://github.com/twbs/icons) and package from Bootstrap, so you can easily use them in any project, or use any other icon set alongside Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript.

They're also open sourced under the MIT license, so you're free to download, use, and customize as you need. This is an alpha release for now, so bear with us as we get familiar with creating and managing hundreds of SVGs. and more icons will be added over time.
