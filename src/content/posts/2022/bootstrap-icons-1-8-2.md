[Bootstrap Icons v1.8.2](https://icons.getbootstrap.com) has arrived with some bug fixes and a refreshed docs design to match our main project.

Here's a quick rundown on the icon fixes:

- Fix cutoff `bank` icon
- Fix `house-heart` and `house-heart-fill` fill-rules
- Fix corners of pentagon icons to match other shapes
- Fix fill-rule for `x-lg`
- Fix cutoff `tool` icon

On the CSS side, we've also added `font-display: block` to help address our icon font affecting Google Lighthouse scores.
