## Install

To get started, install or update via npm:

```sh
npm i bootstrap-icons
```

Or Composer:

```sh
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons
```

You can also [download the release from GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/icons/releases/tag/v1.8.2), or [download just the SVGs and fonts](https://github.com/twbs/icons/releases/download/v1.8.2/bootstrap-icons-1.8.2.zip) (without the rest of the repository files).

## Figma

The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It's the same [Bootstrap Icons Figma file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1042482994486402696/Bootstrap-Icons) you've seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.
