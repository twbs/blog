We've deviated from developing v5.3.0 to ship a new patch release, Bootstrap v5.2.3, with a handful of more urgent bug fixes.

## Highlights

- Added the missing `:root` CSS variables to our utilities bundle
- Fixed the deprecation warning with Sass 1.56.0
- Fixed the RTL `translate()` direction for carousels
- Fixed tooltip and popover disposal inconsistencies

We're heading right back to it with v5.3.0 with support for color modes, new utilities, and more. Look for a pre-release of that soon.

## Get the release

**Head to <https://getbootstrap.com> for the latest.** It's also been pushed to npm:

```sh
npm i bootstrap@v5.2.3
```
