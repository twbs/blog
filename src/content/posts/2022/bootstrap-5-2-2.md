Bootstrap v5.2.2 has landed with new bug fixes and documentation updatesâ€”keep reading to see what's changed!

## Highlights

- **Accordion**
  - Use Sass variable for the accordion color instead of an invalid CSS variable
- **Buttons**
  - Undo changes to `.btn:hover` from v5.2.1. We now explicitly target `.btn-check` styles instead.
- **Dropdowns**
  - Temporarily restore ability for dropdowns to work without an explicit `data` attribute (will be removed again in v6)
- **Modals**
  - Improve modal event listeners
  - Use `<h1>` for all `.modal-title` instances in our docs
- **Tables**
  - Don't redefine `$border-color` in `table-variant()` mixin
- **Tabs**
  - Tabs no longer autofocus and cause pages to jump on `tab.show()`
  - Fix `.active` class toggling of tabs within dropdowns
- **Toasts**
  - Properly set toast `z-index` on `.toast-container` as opposed to individual `.toast`s that don't receive any other positioning
- **Tooltips**
  - Fix tooltip selectors with `title` attribute on dynamically created elements
