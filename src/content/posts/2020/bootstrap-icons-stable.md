After five alphas over the last nine months, Bootstrap Icons has officially gone stable with our v1.0.0 release! We're now over 1,100 icons and are on track to add hundreds more in our upcoming minor releases. This has been a labor of love and I'm thrilled to ship this latest update.

Since our fifth alpha two months ago, over a third of our icons have been redrawn as we fine-tuned paths and shapes. Much of the redrawing and improvements here came as preparation for an icon font, but regrettably that's been pushed back to a v1.1.0 release as the tooling for generating fonts from SVGs has proven more difficult to get right.

## 1,100+ icons

Our first alpha had just over 200 icons, and here we are with 1,120 icons in our first stable release. And we'll only have more in future releases.

## Usage

If you've been following along these last several months, you'll know Bootstrap icons are SVG based. That makes them super easy to import, customize, and extendâ€”no matter the project. While they're part of the Bootstrap family, they can be used anywhere. That's because they're released under the MIT license.

Use them as embedded SVGs, as external assets with `<img>` tags, as an SVG sprite, or even embedded in your CSS. [Head to the docs to learn more.](https://icons.getbootstrap.com)

## Install

To get started, install via npm:

```sh
npm i bootstrap-icons
```

You can also [download the release from GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/icons/releases/tag/v1.0.0), or [download just the SVGs](https://github.com/twbs/icons/releases/download/v1.0.0/bootstrap-icons-1.0.0.zip) (without the rest of the repository files).

## Figma

For the Figma users out there, you can also snag the [icons from Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/9YmlUAwhMv99G4yP4yN7Jy/Bootstrap-Icons-v1.0.0?node-id=0%3A1).

## Up next

We'll revisit the icon font hopefully in time for our next v1.1.0 release. In addition, there are already another 200+ icons drawn and plans for even more after. We'll continue to fine-tune and iterate on these icons, so keep the feedback and requests coming.
