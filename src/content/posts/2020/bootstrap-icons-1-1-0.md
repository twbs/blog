Our first minor release for Bootstrap Icons is here, with over 30 new icons and a few bug fixes. New icons include fill variations for our emoji icons, including a few new emojis, and several new file type icons.

## 30+ new icons

Here's a look at our file and emoji icons as of v1.1.0. New in this release for emojis are the wink and heart eyes, along with fill versions for the full set. In addition, we've added icons for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and a general bar chart file type.
