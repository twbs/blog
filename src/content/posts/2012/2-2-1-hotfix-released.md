After the [2.2.0 release last night]({{< relref "/posts/2012/bootstrap-2-2-0-released" >}}), a few bugs were reported, but only one major one: [malfunctioning carousels](https://twitter.com/getbootstrap/status/263327129905811459). To address that, [@fat](https://twitter.com/fat) just pushed out a 2.2.1 hotfix release that fixes the bug. Upgrading should be super simple given the scope of this release.

Once more, apologies for any hiccups and happy Bootstrapping!
