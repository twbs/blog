Bootstrap v5.3.7 was just released with some follow-up fixes from our migration to Astro, plus a handful of small fixes. We expect to have another patch release shortly due to at least one recent regression, so stay tuned for that.

In the mean time, here are some highlights!

### Docs

- Fixed broken **"View on GitHub"** URLs
- Corrected HTML `<head>` content generated by the **"Download examples"** button
- Refined sanitizer documentation for clarity and completeness
- Improved accessibility in the **"On this page"** table of contents and section heading anchor links
- Relocated ads to the right sidebar to minimize content reflow
- Added a new section on the **Download** page for the *Intelissence* extension
- Clarified the **"Via JavaScript"** usage example for *Accordion Collapse*
- Made internal documentation improvements to support future maintenance *(no visible user impact)*
- Mention CDN `integrity` and `crossorigin` attributes in introduction page
- Enhance floating labels `placeholder` usage description
- Add example of showing dynamic range value with output

### Sass

- Consolidated multiple `'none'` values in the `box-shadow` Sass mixin for cleaner output

### JavaScript

- Fixed popover and tooltip behavior with a `trigger: "hover click"` configuration

### Build tools

- Added recommended **VSCode extensions and settings** configuration to the repository
