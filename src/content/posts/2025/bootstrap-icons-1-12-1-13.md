In the last few weeks, a handful of new [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com) releases have gone out. Here's a recap of what's new in our v1.12.x and v1.13.x releases so far.

## v1.12

v1.12.0 added a single icon, mostly because people wouldn't stop asking for it haha, and v1.12.1 added a page to the docs for it. That was all for [Bluesky](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/bluesky/).

## v1.13.0 and v1.13.1

New in v1.13.0 are several icons, some guidance around how to use Sass files with Vite, and a few little bug fixes to some fill rules. v1.13.1 was a hotfix to resolve an issue with search on our docs.

Here are the new icons in v1.13.0:

## Figma

The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It's the same [Bootstrap Icons Figma file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1042482994486402696/Bootstrap-Icons) you've seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.
