Our latest [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com) update has arrived to fix a few bugs and improve our build tooling. Keep reading for what's new.

## Key changes

Here are the highlights from this release:

- Updated: PowerPoint icons now look more capitalized
- Fixed: `skip-forward` and `skip-backward` icons are now properly named
- Fixed: `mic` and `record` icons no longer appear filled
- Fixed: Codepoints for icon font will no longer change between versions
- Upgraded SVGO to v2.3.0, bringing some minor SVG optimizations to ~200 icons

The update to codepoints is the most important change in this release. It ensures the `content` property values for each icon doesn't change. This gives our icon font more stability between versions, allowing for easier upgrades and maintenance.
