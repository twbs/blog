[Bootstrap Icons v1.7.0](https://icons.getbootstrap.com) is here with 120 new and updated icons, taking us over 1,500 total icons for the project! It's the largest update since the initial release, so keep reading to see what's new.

## 120 new icons

This update was a lot of fun for me—drawing all these tiny computer parts most of all! There are dozens of new computer related icons for parts, ports, and peripheral devices. There are also several new brand icons, including Meta, and some other fun icons like a new robot head and a boombox.
