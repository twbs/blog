[Bootstrap Icons v1.5.0](https://icons.getbootstrap.com) adds 45 new icons across a few categories as I continue to round out the set. Keep reading to see what's new!

## 45 new icons

The primary goal with this release was to round out some of the most requested icons to date. Here's the lowdown:

- First up are large versions of our dash, plus, slash, x, and other alert signage icons. The existing icons are based on their placement in other shapes, so rather than upsize those ones and potentially break things for folks, I've added new large options.

- Commerce icons have a huge update with new currency options, banks, insert credit card, vaults/safes, and even a couple piggy banks.

- For people and identity, we've added our first gender icons for female, male, trans, and ambiguous. It's just the start, as I'm sure there are significant gender and identity roles I'm missing. Please open an issue with feedback if there are improvements I can make here to be more inclusive of everyone.

- On the communications side, there's finally a translate icon and bells with slash.

- And to round it out, there's a new VR headset icon, a couple new geo pin icons, and some new social options like Messenger, Reddit, WhatsApp, and more.
