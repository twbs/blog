Our first patch release for Bootstrap 5 has landed with v5.0.1! We've fixed a handful of bugs in our CSS and JS while also resolving a few issues with our docs and examples.

- Validated inputs in `.input-group`s no longer render behind sibling elements
- Prevent `accent-bg` from leaking in nested tables
- Modal backdrops no longer throw Uncaught TypeError when initialized through JS
- Refactored disposing properties into the base component
- Extracted static `DATA_KEY` and `EVENT_KEY` to the base component
- Merged `transitionend` listener callbacks into one method
- Popovers and tooltips have a streamlined config property
- Toasts no longer automatically hide on focus or hover
- No longer redefining `$list-group-color` in the list group loop

Our docs and examples also received a few updates:

- Fixed Sidebars example not rendering correctly in Chrome
