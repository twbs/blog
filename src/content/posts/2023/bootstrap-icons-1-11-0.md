[Bootstrap Icons v1.11.0](https://icons.getbootstrap.com) has arrived with 100 new iconsâ€”including new floppy disk icons, additional brand icons, new person icons, new emojis, some birthday cake, a few new science icons, and more. We're now at **over 2,000 icons**!

## 100 new icons

Here's a quick look at all the new icons in v1.11.0:

[Check out the pull request](https://github.com/twbs/icons/pull/1792) for all the details on which icons were added and which were updated.

I've also started adding a new `added` tag to icon pages with this release. So far I've only tagged v1.10.0 and v1.11.0 versions, but more will come. Once those are all tagged, you'll be able to search for icons added in each release. Stay tuned!
