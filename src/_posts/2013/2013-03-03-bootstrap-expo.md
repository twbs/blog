[![Bootstrap Expo](/assets/img/2013/03/bootstrap-expo.jpg)]({{ site.expo }})

Today we're launching a new project to showcase the absolute best projects built on Bootstrap, the [Bootstrap Expo]({{ site.expo }}).

The Bootstrap Expo is all hosted on GitHub, meaning recommending new sites is as easy as [opening a new issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-expo/issues/new). It also keeps the primary Bootstrap repo focused on code and documentation, and not dozens of extraneous images.

As a side note, the Expo is the second project appearing under the [twbs organization](https://github.com/twbs) (this blog is already there in private mode). We'll be moving Bootstrap and the Customizer over with v3 soon.

Until then, enjoy and <3,
