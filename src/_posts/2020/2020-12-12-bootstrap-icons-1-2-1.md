Just a quick release to fix a typo in our `package.json` for including the font files in our published package.

Get it via npm:

```shell
npm i bootstrap-icons
```

You can also [download the release from GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/icons/releases/tag/v1.2.1), or [download just the SVGs and fonts](https://github.com/twbs/icons/releases/download/v1.2.1/bootstrap-icons-1.2.1.zip) (without the rest of the repository files).
