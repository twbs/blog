After five alphas over the last nine months, the Bootstrap Icons project has officially gone stable with our v1.0.0 release! We're now over 1,100 icons and are on track to add hundreds more in our upcoming minor releases. This has been a labor of love and I'm thrilled to ship this latest update.

Since our fifth alpha two months ago, over a third of our icons have been redrawn as we fine-tuned paths and shapes. Much of the redrawing and improvements here came as preparation for an icon font, but regrettably that's been pushed back to a v1.1.0 release as the tooling for generating fonts from SVGs has proven more difficult to get right.

## 1,100+ icons
