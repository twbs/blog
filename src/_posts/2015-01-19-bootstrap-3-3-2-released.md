Bootstrap 3.3.2 is here! This release has been all about bug fixes, accessibility improvements, and documentation updates. We've had over 300 commits from 19 contributors since our last release. Woohoo!

Here are some of the highlights:

- Updated Glyphicons to v1.9.
- Reverted support for delegating multiple tooltips via a single element, because it caused nasty regressions.
- Fixed a regression that broke `wrap: false` for the carousel plugin.
- Added manual vendor prefixing back to carousel CSS to avoid a regression among folks not yet using [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
- Improved accessibility of our examples and added more accessibility guidance to our docs.

We've also deployed two new bots to aid Bootstrap's development:

- [Savage](https://github.com/twbs/savage), a bot to automatically run Sauce cross-browser tests on JavaScript pull requests.
- [@twbs-grunt](https://github.com/twbs-grunt), a bot to automatically keep our compiled `/dist/` files up-to-date
