title: Help test Bootstrap 2.1
---

We're stoked to release Bootstrap 2.1 next week Monday at our [first birthday party](https://twitter-bootstrap-birthday.eventbrite.com/), but to make it a great release, we need your help testing it out.

While 2.0.4 was a smaller release, 2.1 is a much larger effort that closes nearly 100 issues and adds a handful of great features. You can see the full list of changes changes in 2.1 thus far by browsing the [milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues?milestone=7&page=1&state=closed).

## What's included

At a broad level, we've got overhauled docs. They're drastically streamlined, redesigned, and better than ever. They even include a new page for getting started with an overview of the framework. New framework features include **submenu support on dropdowns**, **block level buttons**, and the **affix plugin**. We've made many other key changes, so be sure to check it out.

We'll have a more complete list of changes with our release next week.

## How to help

Just like last time, we're pushing out a release candidate of the 2.1 code and docs. **Here's how you can help us out:**

- Checkout the `2.1.0-wip` branch, or browse the release candidate docs so you can easily load it up on devices and such for testing.
- Load up the new docs in your favorite, or your least favorite, browser or device and start testing.
- [Open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open) to report bugs. Please include as much context and information as possible. If it's a visual bug, please include a screenshot. If it pertains to JavaScript, consider including a [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/).

If you're submitting a pull request against 2.1-wip, be sure to read the [Contributing to Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/wiki/Contributing-to-Bootstrap) wiki page first.
