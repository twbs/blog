Earlier today [Bootstrap]({{ site.main }}/) passed 25,000 watchers on GitHub. For the last few months it has been the most watched project and continues to grow at an alarming rate. In fact, I recall writing about [8,700 watchers back in October](https://markdotto.com/2011/10/28/floored/). Jacob and I are still both in awe of how this former internal pet project has grown into one of the most popular front-end frameworks on the Web.

We've still got a lot ahead of us for features, refinement, and more, but we wanted to take a moment once again to thank the community for making Bootstrap the success that it is today.

Thank you. *Really*, **thank you.**

And a special thanks to the 119 contributors (not including Jacob or myself) who have committed code to Bootstrap. Without you guys, a lot of this wouldn't be possible.

Here's to the next 25,000!

<3,
