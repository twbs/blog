title: Help test Bootstrap 2.0.3
---

Our next release, [2.0.3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues?milestone=10&state=open), is almost ready to rock, but we need your help to get the finish line in the best shape possible. Similar to what we did for the big 2.0 launch, we're asking for the community's help in testing out the release's work-in-progress branch. We have a ton of bug fixes—another 80 or so since 2.0.2—and want to have the highest quality release we can.

## Why?

Good question. 2.0.2 introduced some bad bugs in component behavior, publicized outdated documentation, and introduced some ugly regressions. That sucks, and when those things happen, we get held up tracking them down because we missed something in our haste to get a release out the door. We want to focus all our efforts on the 2.1 release after 2.0.3, and to do that we need to get as bug free as we can with this one.

We'll leave 2.0.3-wip open for widespread testing all this week (April 16-20) and then push a release while Jacob and I are in London on April 24. That should give folks, including us, enough time to test the waters and report any back on any issues.

## How?

Just like last time, we're pushing out a release candidate of the 2.0.3 code and docs. Here's how you can help us out:

- Head to GitHub and checkout the `2.0.3-wip` branch.
- Don't want to check out any code? [We're hosting the latest version of the docs here (`http://203rc1.getbootstrap.com`) so you can easily load it up on devices and such for testing.
- Load up the new docs in your favorite, or your least favorite, browser or device and start testing.
- When you find a bug or have feedback, [open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open). Please include as much context and information as possible. If it's a visual bug, please include a screenshot. If it pertains to JavaScript, consider including a [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/).
- If it's a code fix you can make yourself, go ahead and submit a pull request against `2.0.3-wip`. Be sure to read the [Contributing to Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/wiki/Contributing-to-Bootstrap) wiki page first though for a bit of insight into our code practices. (Unsure how to submit a pull request? [Learn more here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).)

We're only human, and we're bound to make a few mistakes in our code as Bootstrap continues to grow. Thanks in advance for all your help and support—it's appreciated more than you know.
