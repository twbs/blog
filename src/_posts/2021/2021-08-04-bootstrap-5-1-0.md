## CSS Grid

<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/css-grid/">
  <img src="/assets/img/2021/08/bootstrap-css-grid-docs.png" alt="CSS Grid docs" class="border">
</a>

We've added an experimental version of a [new CSS Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/css-grid/) as an **opt-in replacement** to our default grid system. To enable it, disable the default grid, by setting `$enable-grid-classes: false` and enable the CSS Grid by setting `$enable-cssgrid: true`. Once recompiled, you'll be able to switch to the new classes. Our new CSS Grid docs page has all the details and some helpful examples to get you started.

Shipping CSS Grid support as experimental allows us to play with things a bit without breaking backward compatibility for folks. Please help us out by testing it and sharing feedback. We expect it to go stable for widespread use in a future minor release.

**[Read the Bootstrap CSS Grid docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/css-grid/)** for more info.

## Offcanvas in navbars

<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/navbar/#offcanvas">
  <img src="/assets/img/2021/08/bootstrap-navbar-offcanvas.png" alt="Offcanvas navbar example" class="border">
</a>

We've expanded our `.navbar-expand-*` classes (see what we did there?) to include support for offcanvases inside the navbar. Wrap your navbar elements with the appropriate offcanvas HTML, point your navbar toggler button to the offcanvas, and voila.

**[Head to the offcanvas navbar docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/navbar#offcanvas)** for more information and a live demo.

## Placeholders

<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/placeholders/">
  <img src="/assets/img/2021/08/bootstrap-placeholders.png" alt="Placeholders example" class="border">
</a>

There's a new component in town with [placeholders](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/placeholders/), a way to provide temporary blocks in lieu of real content to help indicate that something is still loading in your site or app. Our first iteration here aims to only provide the HTML and CSS—it's up to you to implement these placeholders with whatever custom code you might need.

Consider the basic Bootstrap card component shown above.

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="..." class="card-img-top" alt="...">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

Here it is rebuilt with glowing placeholder bars to indicate something is still loading.

```html
<div class="card" aria-hidden="true">
  <img src="..." class="card-img-top" alt="...">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title placeholder-glow">
      <span class="placeholder col-6"></span>
    </h5>
    <p class="card-text placeholder-glow">
      <span class="placeholder col-7"></span>
      <span class="placeholder col-4"></span>
      <span class="placeholder col-4"></span>
      <span class="placeholder col-6"></span>
      <span class="placeholder col-8"></span>
    </p>
    <a href="#" tabindex="-1" class="btn btn-primary disabled placeholder col-6"></a>
  </div>
</div>
```

**[Head to the placeholder docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/placeholders/)** to learn more.

## Horizontal collapse

Hot damn, we've finally added official support for [horizontally collapsing](https://twbs-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/5.1/components/collapse/#horizontal)! The collapse plugin has been able to detect `width` vs `height` for some time (even in v4), but we never had a working example in our docs until now. Add the `.collapse-horizontal` modifier class to transition the `width` instead of `height` and set a `width` on the immediate child element.

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseWidthExample" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseWidthExample">
  Toggle width collapse
</button>

<div style="min-height: 120px;">
  <div class="collapse collapse-horizontal" id="collapseWidthExample">
    <div class="card card-body" style="width: 300px;">
      This is some placeholder content for a horizontal collapse. It's hidden by default and shown when triggered.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Heads up!** You may need some `min-height` or `height` to avoid excessive browser repainting, as we've included in our demo above.

## Stack and vertical rule helpers

While utilities get most of the spotlight these days, helpers are still incredibly useful. [Our newest helpers are called stacks](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/helpers/stacks/) and they're shortcuts for vertical and horizontal stacks of elements. They're inspired by the open source [Pylon](https://almonk.github.io/pylon) project, which was in turn inspired by iOS's stacks. Right now, stacks aren't responsive, but that can easily change with your feedback.

To create a vertical stack, wrap a series of elements in `.vstack`. Use `.gap-*` utilities on the parent (or set individual `margin` utilities) to quickly space elements.

<img src="/assets/img/2021/08/bootstrap-vstack.png" alt="Bootstrap vstack example" class="border">

```html
<div class="vstack gap-3">
  <div class="bg-light border">First item</div>
  <div class="bg-light border">Second item</div>
  <div class="bg-light border">Third item</div>
</div>
```

Want a horizontal stack? Use `.hstack` instead.

<img src="/assets/img/2021/08/bootstrap-hstack.png" alt="Bootstrap vstack example" class="border">

```html
<div class="hstack gap-3">
  <div class="bg-light border">First item</div>
  <div class="bg-light border">Second item</div>
  <div class="bg-light border">Third item</div>
</div>
```

To support these stacks, we've also added an additional new helper—`.vr`, or vertical rule. HTML has had native `<hr>` elements for the longest time to create horizontal rules, but never anything for _vertical_ rules. The new `.vr` helper works great in horizontal stacks and other situations where `border`s are a little trickier.

<img src="/assets/img/2021/08/bootstrap-hstack-vr.png" alt="Bootstrap vstack example" class="border">

```html
<div class="hstack gap-3">
  <input class="form-control me-auto" type="text" placeholder="Add your item here...">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Submit</button>
  <div class="vr"></div>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-danger">Reset</button>
</div>
```

## New CSS variables

We've expanded our `:root` CSS variables to include our gray color palette, new `<body>` variables, and new `RGB` variables for our theme colors. The grayscale colors join our existing color and theme color variables to complete the set of globally available CSS colors. As the development of v5 progresses, these variables will be used more and more in our components to better enable global theming.

Speaking of, our new `<body>` CSS variables now control the styling of the `<body>`. This is what you'll find in the compiled CSS:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: var(--bs-body-font-family);
  font-size: var(--bs-body-font-size);
  font-weight: var(--bs-body-font-weight);
  line-height: var(--bs-body-line-height);
  color: var(--bs-body-color);
  text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);
  background-color: var(--bs-body-bg);
  -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
}
```

Like all our other `:root` CSS variables, the values for these are [generated from our Sass variables](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/content/reboot/#css-variables). That means that no matter how you customize Bootstrap—via Sass or CSS variables—you haven't lost any functionality or convenience.

**[Read the CSS variables customization docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/customize/css-variables/)** for more info.

## Updated `.bg-*` and `.text-*` utilities

Our new RGB values are built to help us make better use of CSS variables across the entire project. To start, our `background-color` and `color` utilities have been updated to use these new RGB values for real-time customization without recompiling Sass and on-the-fly transparency for any background or text color.

Here's how our `.bg-*` and `.text-*` color utilities look now once compiled:

```css
.bg-success {
  --bs-bg-opacity: 1;
  background-color: rgba(var(--bs-success-rgb), var(--bs-bg-opacity)) !important;
}

.text-primary {
  --bs-text-opacity: 1;
  color: rgba(var(--bs-primary-rgb), var(--bs-text-opacity)) !important;
}
```

We use an RGB version of each color's CSS variable and attach a second CSS variable, `--bs-text-opacity` or `--bs-bg-opacity`, for the alpha transparency (with a default value `1` thanks to a local CSS variable in the ruleset). That means anytime you use `.text-primary` now, your computed `color` value is `rgba(13, 110, 253, 1)`. The local CSS variable inside each `.text-*` class helps avoid inheritance issues when nesting instances of these classes.

To support these changes, we've added some new `.text-opacity-*` and `.bg-opacity-*` utilities. Choose from a predefined set (which you can modify in the utilities API) of classes to quickly change the local CSS variable when a given `.text-*` or `.bg-*` utility is used. For example:

<img src="/assets/img/2021/08/bootstrap-text-opacity.png" alt="Bootstrap text opacity example" class="border">

```html
<div class="text-primary">This is default primary text</div>
<div class="text-primary text-opacity-75">This is 75% opacity primary text</div>
<div class="text-primary text-opacity-50">This is 50% opacity primary text</div>
<div class="text-primary text-opacity-25">This is 25% opacity primary text</div>
```

We expect this approach to make its way to `border` utilities next. Have more CSS variables you'd like to see added? Share your thoughts on a new issue on GitHub. Head to the [color utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/colors/#opacity) or [background utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/background/#opacity) docs to learn more.

## Four new examples

<img src="/assets/img/2021/08/v510-examples.png" alt="" class="border">

We've expanded on our component examples with four new examples that customize some of our core components and implement common patterns. Here's what's new:

- [Footers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/footers/)
- [Dropdowns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/dropdowns/)
- [List groups](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/list-groups/)
- [Modals](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/modals/)

**[Explore all our examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/)** to see more.

## Modal and offcanvas backdrops

We've variablized the class name for our backdrops that are used across our modal and offcanvas components. This comes with a new class for the offcanvas backdrop, `.offcanvas-backdrop`, and perhaps more importantly, some updated `z-index` values.

Previously, there was a single offcanvas `z-index` between the modal and modal backdrop `z-index`s, due to offcanvas sharing the modal's backdrop.

```scss
// Before v5.1.0
$zindex-modal-backdrop:       1040 !default;
$zindex-offcanvas:            1050 !default;
$zindex-modal:                1060 !default;
```

We've changed this to allow offcanvases and modals to work together better with separate `z-index` values for offcanvas, the offcanvas backdrop, modal, and the modal backdrop.

```scss
// After v5.1.0
$zindex-offcanvas-backdrop:   1040 !default;
$zindex-offcanvas:            1045 !default;
$zindex-modal-backdrop:       1050 !default;
$zindex-modal:                1055 !default;
```

Unless you've modified the offcanvas component or its Sass variables, there should be no breaking changes for you.

## And more!

There's a lot more in this release that we didn't include in the highlights above:

- Reverted the ability for `.col-*` classes to override `.row-cols-*` as it caused some breaking bugs in our layouts. We'll revisit and restore it when we can engineer it in a more scalable and easy to maintain way.
- Added new `.opacity-*` utilities (with `0`, `.25`, `.5`, `.75`, and `1` default values).
- Updated several JavaScript plugins with some major cleanups—alerts, collapse, dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips.
- Plugins now accept arguments of different types in the `getInstance` method.
- Added new Sass maps for all our colors, as well as a new `map-merge-multiple()` function to combine Sass maps.
- Updated `data-dismiss` on modals so that it can be outside of a modal using `bs-target`.
- Updated toasts to change show timings and classes to keep toast `display: none` by default.
- Added `Shift` + `Tab` keyboard support to modal and offcanvas components.
- Renamed `Build Tools` page to `Contribute` to better communicate its purpose.
- Fixed `Manipulator.offset()` in Scrollspy to improve scroll position detection.
- Added examples of live alerts to the docs.
