Bootstrap 3.3.6 is here! It's a long overdue release that addresses dozens of CSS bug fixes and documentation updates. We've had over 180 commits and 100 closed issues and pull requests from nearly 30 contributors since our last release. Woohoo!

Here are some of the highlights:

- Added support for an official NuGet package (yeah, it's an old one, but folks still use it!).
- Enabled source maps for our compiled minified CSS.
- Updated over a dozen browser bug entries as browsers continue to fix bugs (aww yeah!).
- Updated several JavaScript plugin docs to clarify usage.
- Made local documentation development easier with a local jQuery fallback.
