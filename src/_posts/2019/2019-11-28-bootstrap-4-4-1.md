Today we're shipping [Bootstrap v4.4.1](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v4.4.1)!

In [v4.4.0]({% post_url 2019/2019-11-26-bootstrap-4-4-0 %}), we added `add()` and `subtract()` functions to avoid errors when using zero values in CSS's built in `calc()` function. While these functions work as expected with our build system, which is based on `node-sass`, some alert developers noticed that [things broke when using another Sass compiler](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/29743) like Dart Sass or Ruby Sass. To resolve this issue, we've tweaked these functions a bit to output what we would expect.

Lastly, we also added a [theming fix](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/29762) for some custom forms in a disabled fieldset.
